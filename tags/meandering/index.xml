      <description>The simplest definition of point bars is that they are sedimentary deposits forming on the inner, convex bank of river bends. [&amp;lsquo;Inner&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;convex&amp;rsquo; bank means that, looking toward the river, the bank is curving around you.] Amadeus W. Grabau, an early &amp;lsquo;influencer&amp;rsquo; in stratigraphy and sedimentary geology, published a beautiful drawing of how meanders grow, point bars evolve, and oxbow lakes form, more than a hundred years ago:</description>

My coauthors are Paul Durkin, at the University of Manitoba, and Jake Covault, at the Bureau of Economic Geology, The University of Texas at Austin. In this blog post, I try to provide a bit more background to our paper.</description>
